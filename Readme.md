# NahamCon CTF 2022

I partecipated in the [NahamCon CTF 2022](https://ctf.nahamcon.com/) and this repository includes solutions for the following challenges:

- Babiersteps (Binary Exploitation)
- Babystep (Binary Exploitation)
- Detour (Binary Exploitation)
- Babyrev (Reversing)
- Flaskmetal Alchemist (Web)
- XORROX (Cryptography)

This is just a subset of the challenges I solved during the CTF.
At the end of the challenge I got 2401 points, and I reached the 256th position in the final scoreboard (out of 4034 teams!).

It was a great learning experience and I really enjoyed!
